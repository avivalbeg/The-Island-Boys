# The-Island-Boys
Using POMDPs and friends to meet on an island of various terrain. 
The point of this project is to get multiple agents who only see a radius around their bodies in a world of oceans and mountains to meet. 
We call this the lovers problem. The two agents want to come together most efficiently. 

Grid is the world 
agent is an individual in the world
